To apply the files generated by this blueprint, execute the following commands:

```
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/docker-infrastructure.yaml
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/docker-environment.yaml
```

Applying the first XL YAML file will create a `docker.Engine` infrastructure CI named docker, applying the second XL YAML file will create an environment with that infrastructure CI.

Instantiate and apply the companion `docker/application` blueprint to create an appliation that can be deployed to this environment.
