## Generic microservice application on AWS EKS 

The blueprint deploys a microservice application to AWS EKS.
XL deploy does the provisioning and deployment, while XL release orchestrates everything.

To deploy this blueprint with XL Platform follow the below steps

1. Generate the blueprint with `xl blueprint -t aws/microservice-generic`
2. Apply the generated yaml configurations using XL CLI

    ```
    xl apply -f xebialabs.yaml
    ```

3. Go to XL Release and look for the {{.AppName}}-release-pipeline and start a new release from it.
