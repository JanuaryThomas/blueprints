## e-commerce microservice application on AWS EKS 

The blueprint deploys an e-commerce microservice created using JHipster to AWS EKS.
XL deploy does the provisioning and deployment, while XL release orchestrates everything.

To deploy this blueprint with XL Platform follow the below steps

1. Git clone [https://github.com/xebialabs/e-commerce-microservice/tree/blueprint-demo](https://github.com/xebialabs/e-commerce-microservice/tree/blueprint-demo)
2. Create a new folder, for example `xl-platform`, and navigate into it
3. Generate the blueprint with `xl blueprint -t aws/microservice-ecommerce`
4. Move the `kubernetes` folder from the root directory into this new folder
5. Apply the generated yaml configurations

    ```
    xl apply -f xebialabs.yml
    ```

4. Go to XL Release and look for the {{.AppName}}-release-pipeline and start a new release from it.
