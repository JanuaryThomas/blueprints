### Prerequisites

To apply the files generated by this blueprint, execute the following commands:

```
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/kubernetes-infrastructure.yaml
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/kubernetes-environment.yaml
```

Applying the first XL YAML file will create a `k8s.Master` infrastructure CI for your Kubernetes cluster, as well as a `k8s.Namespace` for the namespace you specified. Applying the second XL YAML file will create an environment that refers to the `k8s.Namespace` CI.

Instantiate and apply the companion `kubernetes/application` blueprint to create an application that can be deployed to this environment.
