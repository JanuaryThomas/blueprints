To apply the file generated by this blueprint, execute the following command:

```
$ xl apply -f xebialabs/kubernetes-application.yaml
```

Applying that XL YAML file will create a deployment package with a single `k8s.ResourcesFile` for the Kubernetes resource file that you specified.

Instantiate and apply the companion `kubernetes/environment` blueprint to create an environment to which this package can be deployed.
